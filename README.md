# blackjacks
A compilation of different terminal versions of Blackjack, by different Studio BDT members.

## Black-Jack
The original, by NeoRazer. 

Built in C++, it is a basic version of Blackjack where you face off against an AI and try to earn as much money as possible. 

Here, the bot plays like a player, where it can choose when to hit or stand.

## blackhack
The second, by ImmatureGoat.

Built in Java, it is an improved version of NeoRazer's Black-Jack. 

Here, the dollar sign is actually used, and there are shop items such as fake aces, incinerators, and guns. 

As well as that, the bot actually plays like a dealer, where it has a system of whether to hit or stand.

## hackjack
The third, by SamZua. 

Also built in C++, this is an "improved" version of ImmatureGoat's blackhack. 

Similar to blackhack, there are shop items, such as double up, but there is also a chip system.
